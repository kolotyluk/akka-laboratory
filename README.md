## Akka Typed

`net.kolotyluk.akka.laboratory.Main` takes the documentation from
[Akka Typed](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.5/scala/typed.html)
to a working example with explanations of what is going on via
scaladoc.

Akka Typed makes a number of safety and robustness improvements
in working with Actors. Typed Actors and typed Behaviors replace
the untyped Actors with mechanisms to better defined the
protocols each actor supports.
